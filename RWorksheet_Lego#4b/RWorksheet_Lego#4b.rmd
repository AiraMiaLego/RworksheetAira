##Using Loop Function
for() loop
##1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in
Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.
```{r}
vectorA<-c(1:5)
matrix<- matrix(0,5,5)
vectorA
matrix

for (i in 1:5){
  for ( j in 1:5){
    matrix[i, j]<- abs(vectorA[i] - vectorA[j])
  }
}
matrix
```
##2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in Figure 2
```{r}
size<- 5
for (i in 1:size){
  cat(paste(rep("*",i), collapse=""), "\n")
}
```
##3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st inputup to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.
```{r}

```
